Q5- What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them

The differences between HTML and JSX are; 

1)  In JSX, you must return a single parent element, or it won't compile while In HTML, you are free to do whatever you want as you don’t have to return a single parent element.


2) In JSX, it is possible to write JavaScript directly. You can do this by putting the JavaScript in curly braces {...}. Whereas in HTML, you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript.

3) Tags can self-close in JSX. That is, it is possible to have<div></div> as<div /> and<span></span> as<span /> while Self-closing tags in HTML can self-close without the slash before the right angle bracket, that it<br /> could work as<br>. In JSX, you need to include the slash. 

Q6- Why can’t browsers read JSX?

Browsers can't read JSX because they are not valid JavaScript, browsers can't read it directly; they do not know what to do with it, so we need a transpiler to translate it to React.
